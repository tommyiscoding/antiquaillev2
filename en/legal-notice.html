            </p>
            <p>
              The director and owner of the <a href="./index.html">www.lantiquaille.com</a> website commits to ensure that the collection and processing of personal data complies with the General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR).
            </p>
            <p>
              This personal data protection policy may be revised at any time, in particular with a view to complying with any legislative and regulatory changes. The date of its update is identified at the top of this policy.

            <p>
              <span class="bold">Personal data collected:</span><br>
              The <a href="./index.html">www.lantiquaille.com</a> website may collect personal data when necessary for the purpose and exercise of its mission.<br>
              However, it is possible to visit the <a href="./index.html">www.lantiquaille.com</a> website without necessarily providing personal data.<br>
              The <a href="./index.html">www.lantiquaille.com</a> website only collects personal data with the explicit agreement and always on a voluntary basis of the Internet users.<br><br>
              At present, this data collection can be carried out at two different points on the site:
              <ol>
                <li>Either at the top of the main page as part of the Internet user's contribution to the questionnaire on the market research provided by the site</li>
                <li>Either at the bottom of the main page if the Internet user wishes to remain informed about the progress of the entrepreneurial project "Les Laboratoires de L'Antiquaille" as presented on the website.</li>
              </ol>
              <p>
                The site is subject to change, and these methods of collection are, therefore, subject to amendments. 
              <br>
              In any case, the <a href="./index.html">www.lantiquaille.com</a> website does not collect any sensitive data. This is mainly contact data (title-gender, surname, first name, email, residence) and, in the case of the questionnaire, in addition to the contact data, information on the Internet user's age group, preferences and consumption habits for anti-ageing care and profession.

              <br>

              Under no circumstances is the data collected for external commercial purposes. The director and owner of the site <a href="./index.html">www.lantiquaille.com</a>, Florent Gerphagnon, commits to never commercialize the data collected by the site to third parties.

            <p>

              <br>
              This personal data protection policy is subject to French law.
